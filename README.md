## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections:

With this election analysis complete, we can use this code for more for further analysis in the future. We can use the same outline in code, and determine which gender voted for which candidate. This will give insight on who's coming out to vote and who they're coming out to vote for. If we come to find out a gender is coming out to vote more than another, that can be something to further look into with data collecting and investigating to bridge any voting gaps. 

We can also use this code to see how many votes per county the candidates had received. This would allow insight into which candidates had a bigger impact in, and further analysis and data collecting can be brought forth on what issues matter most to those voters in those counties and more.
