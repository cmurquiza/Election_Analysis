- There were 369,711 votes cast in total
- The candidate list were: 
      - Charles Casper Stockham
      - Diana DeGette

## Challenge Overview

 - Python and VS Code were used to analyze and automate these results to conduct the analysis quickly and efficiently than if you were to use excel. Based on these results, Diana DeGette is the clear winner by a large margin compared to her counterpart candidates. Being able to conduct all of the answers to those questions and present them in this manner allows for easier viewing and understanding for not just the Colorado Election Board, but also for the people awaiting the results who voted. 

## Challenge Summary
 
 - There were 3 candidates who ran for office and Diana DeGette won with the most votes and percentages. Further analysis could be done to see which counties voted for which candidate, how much of each gender voted for each of the candidates, and more to get a bigger understanding why Diana won by such a large margin and dig deeper about what it could mean and why it happened.
